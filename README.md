GAGE-BD Ontology Visualization
The html and jpeg files for each webpage are uploaded in this repo. If they belong to the Inflammaing dataset, then it will have a "inflammaging_" prefix, if they belong to Integrated GAGE-BD dataset, then it will have a "integrated_gage" prefix. Html and jpeg files **without** prefixes belong to the full ontology.
