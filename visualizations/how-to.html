		<h4 class="card__heading">About VariCat</h4>
    <p> This Variable Categorization (VariCat) program was created to support the process of integrating and harmonizing datasets related to older adults with bipolar disorder (OABD). 
      This program was created under the Global Aging & Geriatric Experiments in Bipolar Disorder Database (GAGE-BD) project, an international research initiative, which  
      pools archival research and clinical datasets to provide an evidence platform with potential to advance knowledge on OABD.
      Visit the <a href= "https://github.com/cwru-non-academic/varicat"> Github repo </a> to access the R code used to created the html files and jpeg files for making this site.

  Use the navigation bar to view the visualizations of the complete ontology, which shows all possible categories and sub-categories under this ontology created to encompass as many categories as possible relevant to OABD.
  Click on each category's link to view the interactive visualization for a given category. To view the labels of each node, hover over the node. To prevent the label from disappearing, click on the node. To remove the label from view, click on the node again.

  The example datasets Inflammaging and Integrated GAGE-BD show how researchers can use VariCat to assess the availability of data across categories. The size of the nodes correspond to the number of variables in that sub-category. The label that appears when hovering over each node is the name of that category, and the corresponding
  number is the number of variables categorized exclusively to that sub-category. All main categories will not have a number displayed next to them since a variable will be categorized as either a sub- or sub-sub category. The node that indicate the main category is colored in black.
